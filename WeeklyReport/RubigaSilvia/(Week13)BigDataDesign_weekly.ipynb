    "\n",
    "1. ANN models can process large numbers of protein data and make predictions rapidly.\n",
    "2. ANN models can handle a wide variety of protein data and can generalize patterns developed from training data to make predictions on new unseen proteins.\n",
    "3. ANN models can incorporate multiple types of data such as protein sequences, structures, etc., to improve the prediction accuracy and develop complex relationships.\n",
    "4. ANN can learn complex patterns and relationships in protein data, leading to improved accuracy in function prediction compared to traditional rule-based methods.\n",
    "5. ANN models have the potential to uncover novel protein functions by identifying subtle patterns and relationships that are not apparent with just manual observation.\n",

    "2. Dataset used for training and testing the ANN model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maximum labels assigned: 1500\n",

    "\n",
    "- The function 'assign_labels' is used to assign labels to proteins based on the presence of selected terms within their annotations.\n",
    "- The intersection between the 'selected_terms' set and the 'annotations' is calculated to identify the terms that exist in both the selected terms and the annotations.\n",
    "- An array is used to check if each term from the 'selected_terms' array is present in the 'intersection' array.\n",
    "- The 'assign_labels' function is then applied to each group of annotations in the 'train_seq' dataframe, and the results are stored in the 'labels' variable.\n"
